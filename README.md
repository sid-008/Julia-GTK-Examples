# julia-GTK-examples

A few basic gtk.jl examples I made to learn to use GTK with julia
Its honestly better to use python/C/CPP/Vala.
I do like the syntaxing, its simple and easy on the eyes.
But dev work on supporting libraries like reactive and observables hasn't made progress since 2020.
Gtk.jl itself has recieved fairly regular development
Documentation is incredibly sparse.
